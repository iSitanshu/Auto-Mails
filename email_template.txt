Hello [Sir/Ma'am],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to express my interest in the Software Development Engineer 1 (SDE-1) position at [XYZ Company]. As a final-year B.Tech student specializing in Information Technology at KIET Group of Institutions, I am eager to leverage my skills in software development and problem-solving to contribute to your esteemed team.

During my internships at Protut and Oasis Infobyte, I gained practical experience in front-end and back-end development using ReactJS, Tailwind, and Node.js, creating scalable solutions that enhanced user engagement. My academic projects, including EventHub and a Food Delivery System, further strengthened my expertise in designing responsive, feature-rich web applications.

In addition to my development experience, I have demonstrated strong analytical skills by solving over 500 problems on LeetCode and earning a 3-star rating on CodeChef. My active participation in hackathons has also equipped me with the ability to collaborate effectively in dynamic, fast-paced environments.

I am particularly drawn to companies's commitment to innovation and excellence and would be honored to contribute to your groundbreaking projects. I have attached my resume for your review and would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences align with your team's objectives.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
