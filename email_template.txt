Hello [Sir/Ma'am],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my interest in the SDE-1 position at [XYZ Company]. As a final-year B.Tech student in Information Technology at KIET Group of Institutions, I am passionate about developing scalable, user-focused web applications and eager to contribute to your engineering team.

During my internships at MythoQuantum Explorers and Protut, I worked extensively with ReactJS, Node.js, MongoDB, Express.js, and FastAPI, building real-world applications such as a full-stack data analytics platform and a mentorship/project tracking system used by over 1,000 users.

My independent projects reflect the same drive: I developed EventHub, an event management platform used by 1,000+ users; a Food Delivery System with JWT-based auth and real-time tracking; and a Restaurant and Hall Booking System that supports live reservations and role-based access across admin, staff, and guest dashboards.

In addition, I have solved 600+ LeetCode problems and hold a 3-star CodeChef rating, which has strengthened my algorithmic thinking and coding fluency.

I am excited by [XYZ Company] commitment to innovation and would be thrilled to contribute to your mission. I have attached my resume and would welcome the chance to further discuss how I can add value to your team.

Best regards,
